Welcome to my personal homepage!

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. My academic journey started with the guidance of the distinguished Xiaobing Feng, under whose mentorship I completed my doctorate degree at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ICT, CAS).

My research interests are focused on parallel computing and compiler optimization for machine learning applications. I am passionate about exploring how we can harness the power of parallel processing to solve complex computational problems and how compiler optimizations can further enhance the performance of these systems.

I am always open to collaboration and look forward to engaging with fellow researchers, and students. Thank you for visiting, and if you have any questions or wish to discuss potential research opportunities, please do not hesitate to contact me.
